## Overview![img.png](img.png)

A game where babies are seeking revenge against those who stole candy from them because it was "too easy"...

The system provides the following:

* There are three user roles (vendor, consumer, and admin) in which the vendors can update the app to include available menu options, changes, or specials.
* Top-level index pages for Food and Vendors.
* Initialization code to define Vendors and Foods and relations between them.
* The ability to leave reviews for vendors.
* Accessing the menu page, vendor page, and review pages requires user-level authorization, while editing menu data and vendor profiles requires either vendor-level or admin-level authorization.
