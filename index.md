The Triangle represents a key, the blue square represents a candy, the red square represents a baby, and the green circle represents a dirty diaper.
The evacuation area is the green box but is only accessible when the candy has been obtained.

A game where babies are seeking revenge against those who stole candy from them because it was "too easy"...

The system provides the following:

* Top down, 2D/3D view
* Characters are looking for you so be stealthy
* Use the environment to find ways to get the candy
* Use your arsenal to distract or confuse the adults to leave candy vulnerable


## Beggining Stages

The Goal is to avoid the parents at all costs because if they catch you, its GAME OVER! Pay attention to where the candy is because there are tricks and traps throughout the map. Use your diaper to stun the enemies and make your escape if detected. Obtain the keys to open doors and obtain any candy that might be behind them.

### Keys

Stealing back the candy the adults took from you (because of how easy it was) is the reason you here, don't leave any behind!
