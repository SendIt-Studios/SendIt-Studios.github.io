The Triangle represents a key, the blue square represents a candy, the red square represents a baby, and the green circle represents a dirty diaper.
The evacuation area is the green box but is only accessible when the candy has been obtained.

A game where babies are seeking revenge against those who stole candy from them because it was "too easy"...

The system provides the following:

* Top down, 2D/3D view

* Use the environment to find ways to get the candy
* Use your arsenal to distract or confuse the adults to leave candy vulnerable
